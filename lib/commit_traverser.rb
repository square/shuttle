# Mixin that adds the ability to traverse the blobs of a `Git::Object::Commit`.

module CommitTraverser

  # run indefinitely if there are cycles in the tree graph.
  #
  # @param [Git::Object::Commit] commit A commit to traverse.
  # @yield [path, blob] The operation to perform on each blob found. Throw
  #   `:prune` to skip processing any further blobs under the current tree.
  # @yieldparam [String] path The path to a blob, with leading slash.
  # @yieldparam [Git::Object::Blob] blob A blob in the commit.
