  li This tool will copy all approved translations from 'from' locale into not-translated 'to' locale.
  li It will not override already existing translations in the target locale. If the string is already translated in the target locale, it will not be updated.
  li You can only copy between the locales which are in the same language family (same iso639), and in your targeted locales.
  li This tool will not create the translation records. The translation records should exist in the database beforehand.
  li This is not an instantaneous task. This task will run in the background for a while. Check Sidekiq for progress.
