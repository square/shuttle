# Adds the {#sidekiq_batch} method to models, which in turn adds more helper methods to manage
# the sidekiq batch and sidekiq batch status.
#
# @example
#   class Document < ActiveRecord::Base
#     extend SidekiqBatchManager
#     sidekiq_batch :parse_batch do |batch|
#       batch.description = "Parse document #{id} (#{name})"
#       batch.on :success, ParseFinisher, document_id: id
#     end
#   end
#
#   document = Document.new
#   document.parse_batch
#   document.parse_batch.jobs do
#     # add jobs here
#   end
#   document.parse_batch_status
#   document.reset_parse_batch_id
#

module SidekiqBatchManager

  # It expects a column in the database table whose name is batch_method_name suffixed with '_id'.
  # For instance, if the batch name is 'import_batch', it expects a 'import_batch_id' column, and
  # defines the following 3 methods: `import_batch`, `import_batch_status` and `reset_import_batch_id!`.

  # @param [Symbol] batch_method_name The batch method name to be created
  # @param [Proc] proc The proc that will be called in the context of this instance with the
  #   sidekiq batch. Use this to configure batch settings such as description or callbacks such
  #   as on_success.
