# Represents a hash of {Section Sections}, and provides a thin layer of abstraction over them.
#
# Importing
# ---------
#
# An Article will be imported after creation, for the first time.
# If the source copy hash or locale settings change, it will be re-imported.
#
# `import!` method is the single point of entry for the import process.
# This will enqueue an ArticleImporter job which will handle the rest
# of the import in a Sidekiq Batch.
#
#
# Name uniqueness
# --------------
#
# The `name` field of Article is treated as a unique identifier within a Project.
#
#
# Locale Settings
# ---------------
# `base_locale` and `locale_requirements` fields store these settings. If nil,
# locale settings are inherited from Project's settings.
#
#
# Associations
