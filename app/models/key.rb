# Represents a unique identifier for a translatable string in a Project. The
# actual content of a key depends on the localization library used by that
# project.
#
# A Key has one base Translation, whose locale matches the Project's base
# locale, and zero or more sibling Translations in the other locales supported
# by the Project. When Translations in all required Locales are marked as
# approved, the Key is marked as ready. When all Keys applicable to a
# Commit/Article are marked as ready, the Commit/Article is marked as ready.
#
# Key uniqueness
# --------------
#
# A key must be unique to a Project (at the time of a specific Commit). However,
# it is not the case in all i18n libraries that a key is unique. For example,
# Android allows multiple strings to share the same key so long as they appear
# under different "qualifiers" (device properties); e.g., two strings can share
# a key if one is for landscape and the other for portrait orientations.
#
# To deal with this, this type of metadata is serialized into the `key` field
# (and therefore represented in the `key_sha` column, on which uniqueness is
# enforced). The original value of the key without this metadata is written to
# the `original_key` field.
#
# Source copy
# -----------
#
# Keys are uniquely referenced in combination with their source copy; in other
# words, when a key's source copy changes, a new Key is generated.
#
#
# Keys that belong to a Section (and Article through Section)
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# A key may belong_to a Section through the section_id column
# (in which case, it will not belong to a commit or blob).
#
# If `index_in_section` is set, it means that this {Key} is an active part of
# this {Section}. If set, it shows its order in all of Section's Keys.
# In that sense, this field serves 2 purposes: a flag for active or not, and keeps
# the order info. If null, it means this Key is not actively used in the Section;
# if set, it's actively used in the Section.
#
# The key field of {Key} will be in this format: `index_in_section:source_copy_sha`.
#   - index_in_section is included because if a paragraph is repeated twice in the Section,
#     we should create 2 separate {Key Keys} for them, with unique key names.
#     When re-importing a Section, we may deactivate a Key in a Section by removing
#     the `index_in_section` field.
#     When that happens, it's important to store the index in the `key` field, because
#     the deactivated {Key} can be activated again, and we would search by the `key` field
#     of {Key}.
#     And it's less error-prone to store the index in the `key` field all the time rather than
#     only when deactivating a Key.
#   - source_copy_sha is included because we need a predictable `key` field, so that we can
#     search by it later. source_copy_sha is the most obvious solution for that.
#
#
# If the {Key} belongs to a Section, `key` field of {Key} is unique in combination with
# the Section id.
