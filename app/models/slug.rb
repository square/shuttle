# Stores slugs used to prettify URLs. For more information, see the
# `Slugalicious` mixin.
#
# As new slugs are created, old ones are marked as inactive and kept around for
# redirect purposes. Once a slug is old enough, it is deleted and its value can
# be used for new records (no longer redirects).

# | `slug`   | The slug, lowercased and normalized. Slugs must be unique to their `sluggable_type` and `scope`. |
# | `active` | Whether this is the most recently generated slug for the sluggable.                              |
# | `scope`  | Freeform data scoping this slug to a certain subset of records within the model.                 |
