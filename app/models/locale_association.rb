# Represents an association between 2 locales.
#
# It's used in multi-lingual translation workbench for fast translations into multiple
# associated locales.
#
# For example, let's assume that you have projects with 'fr' and 'fr-CA' as targeted locales.
# In most cases, their translations would be the same. So, you would want to create a
# {LocaleAssociation} from 'fr' to 'fr-CA', and set `checked` to true and `uncheck_disabled` to false.
# From then on, whenever a translator is translating, say from 'en', to 'fr', they will see a
# checkbox for 'fr-CA' which is checked by default. Translator can uncheck it if they think
# the translations will not be the same. If it's checked when the translator submits the form,
# the translation copy will be copied to both 'fr' & 'fr-CA' translations.
#
# Sometimes, you may want keep a 1:1 relationship between locales. In such cases, you can
# set `checked` & `uncheck_disabled` both. Then, the translator should not be able to uncheck it.
# However, these settings apply to translation workbench only. A translator can edit any single
# translation by going to its edit page even regardless of LocaleAssociations.
