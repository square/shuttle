require 'fileutils'

# A state in a {Project}'s source history. A commit, in the context of this
# program, is a point in the history of a Project that is either approved or not
# approved for release, from a localization standpoint.
#
# Each new Commit, when created, is scanned for importable blobs. These blobs
# are scraped for {Key Keys} and {Translation Translations}, which are added to
# the corpus, and new {Blob} records are created. If the commit shares blobs
# with an already-imported commit, the blob is skipped.
#
# Existing keys are updated with new base translations, if the copy has changed,
# and translations are marked as pending review. Translations are created for
# any new Keys and marked as pending translation and review.
#
# Once all Translations of a Commit are translated and reviewed,
# that Commit is considered localized for that locale. Once all required
# locales have been reviewed, the Commit is ready for release. `after_save`
# hooks on {Translation} automatically manage the `ready` field, and the
# various workers method manage the `loading` field.
#
# Keys are child to a Project, not a Commit. A Commit has a many-to-many
# association that tracks which keys can be found under that commit.
#
# Associations
# ============
